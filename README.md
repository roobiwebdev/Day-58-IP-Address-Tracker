🗓#Day58 of #100DaysChallenge

📎For Day 58, I developed an IP Address Tracker it can automatically detect the user's IP address and display detailed information about its location, timezone, and ISP. Users can also input any IP address or domain to see specific data. Here's what I accomplished:

✅ user-friendly interface for easy IP address tracking

✅ Implemented automatic IP detection and manual input functionality

✅ Displayed the IP address, location, timezone, and ISP information

✅ Integrated a map to visually represent the location of the IP address

⚙️This project was both challenging and rewarding
